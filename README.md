# ReactJS Calculator App

This is a simple calculator web application built using ReactJS. It allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
- Clear the input field.
- Calculate the result of the entered expression.

## Usage
- Enter numerical values and operators by clicking on the buttons.
- Click on the "=" button to calculate the result of the entered expression.
- Click on "C" to clear the input field and start a new calculation.

## How It Works
- The calculator uses React's state management to keep track of the input value.
- When you click on a button (number or operator), it updates the input field's value.
- The "=" button triggers the calculation of the expression using the eval function.
- The "C" button clears the input field.
